Aaryan: implementing API server using fastAPI

2 types of API communication
- web-server to central server
- central server to region servers

API endpoints:
- for web-server to central server
    - create-player (while creating, all the data about player should be passed to this end-point)
    - update-player (only player-id and updated score should be passed to this end-point)
    - global-ranking (no data should be passed, as this end-point will simply return the global ranking)
    - regional-ranking (only region-id should be passed to this end-point)

- for central server to regional servers
    - create-player (to create and replicate player data)   // only send requests to the region which will 
                                                            // store the data based on consisten hashing
    - update-player (update multiple replication with quorum based approach) // only send requests to the region 
                                                            // which has stored the data based on consisten hashing
    - read
        - for gloobal ranking, requests to all the regional nodes
        - for regional ranking, requests only specified regional server and replicated node
